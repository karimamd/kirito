DHH_task.pdf contains answers to questions and some directions
DHH_task.ipynb is the python code used
the SQL file is for Bigquery part 4

I am aware that visuals are missing for Bigquery part, 
Should add them here before the end of weekend but sending the repo now because I said I would send the task on Friday.

Further cleaning and formatting will be done as well before the end of the weekend.
